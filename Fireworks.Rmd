fireworks is a package that allows you to produce a plot that draws values from a random beta distribution and formats them to look like fireworks. 

The user can change two parameters in the function "make_fireworks": 
  1. (background) Which background color to have. This object can take on any color included in the base R colors. It should be formatted as a string character.
  2. (n) How many colors of the rainbow that should be included in the colors of the fireworks.

For example: 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE}
library(fireworks)
make_fireworks(background = "midnightblue", n = 10)
```
